## 3. ✨ Creative Philosophy

| Philosophy | Summary | Rationale and Guidance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Universality & Reinterpretation** | The creative core is based on universal emotions (love, loneliness, desire for transformation) or classic narratives, which are then technologically reconstructed for the modern era. | Use a "core" that transcends time and borders, such as *The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter* or the emotion in **"little monster"**, as the creative foundation. |
| **Seamless Aesthetics** | Provide a consistent and unbroken "aesthetic sensibility" across all touchpoints: business concept, product design, digital assets, and promotional videos. | Ensure users perceive professional dedication and high quality in the brand's worldview, regardless of the engagement point. |
| **Technological Transparency** | Web3 technologies (blockchain, NFTs) should not be the focus, but rather treated as the mechanism that enables **"magical expressions"** and **"new experiences."** | Remove technical barriers, allowing non-Web3 users to join based on emotional motivation. |
